                                            but does conform to applicable Federal Theft Prevention Standards, but I am eligible to import it
                                            because NHTSA has determined that the model and model year of the vehicle to be imported is
                                            eligible for importation into the United States, and the vehicle is not a salvage motor vehicle or a

                                            of the Treasury. If the Administrator of NHTSA determines that the vehicle has not been brought into

                                        5. The vehicle or equipment does not conform to all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety, Bumper

                                               final disposition (and disposition date) of the vehicle or equipment item after completion of the

                                            8. The vehicle was not manufactured primarily for use on the public roads and thus is not a motor
                                                vehicle subject to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety, Bumper, and Theft Prevention Standards or the
                                                equipment item is not a system, part, or component of a motor vehicle and thus is not an item of
                                                motor vehicle equipment subject to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. [591.5(a)]
                                                Attachment: Importer’s statement substantiating that the vehicle was not manufactured for use on
                                                the public roads, or that the equipment item was not manufactured for use on a motor vehicle or is
                                                not an item of motor vehicle equipment. [591.6(a)]

                                            9.  The vehicle or equipment item requires further manufacturing operations to perform its intended
                                                function, other that the addition of readily attachable equipment items such as mirrors, wipers, or tire
                                                and rim assemblies, or minor finishing operations such as painting, and any part of such vehicle that
                                                is required to be marked by the Theft Prevention Standard is marked in accordance with that

                                                Attachment: For a vehicle, a copy of the Incomplete Vehicle Document, issued by the incomplete
                                                vehicle manufacturer, providing guidance on completing the vehicle so that it conforms to all
                                                applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). For an equipment item, a statement
                                                issued by the item’s manufacturer identifying the applicable FMVSS to which the item does not

                                                function. [591.6(b)].

                                            10. The vehicle does not conform to all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety and Bumper Standards
                                                but is being imported solely for the purpose of show and display, and I state that I will comply with
                                                all applicable restrictions on importers of such vehicles as specified in 49 CFR 591.7. [591.5(j)].
                                                Attachment: Copy of NHTSA Permission Letter.

                                            11. The equipment item is subject to the Theft Prevention Standard and is marked in accordance with
                                                the requirements of 49 CFR Part 541. [591.5(k)]

                                            12. The vehicle does not conform to all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety, Bumper, and Theft
                                                Prevention Standards, but I am eligible to import it because all of the following conditions exist:

                                                a. I am a member of the armed forces of a foreign country on assignment in the United States;
                                                b. I am importing the vehicle on a temporary basis, and for my personal use;
                                                c. I will not sell the vehicle to any person in the United States, other than a person eligible to import
                                                a vehicle under this paragraph;
                                                d. I will export the vehicle upon departing the United States at the conclusion of my tour of duty; and
                                                e. I have attached a copy of my official orders. [591.5(h)(2)]

                                                <b>Attachment:</b> Copy of Official Orders.

                                            13. The vehicle does not conform to all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety and Bumper Standards,
                                                but does conform to applicable Federal Theft Prevention Standards, and I am eligible to import it
                                                because I am registered with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592 and such registration is not
                                                suspended and has not been revoked, I have informed NHTSA that I intend to petition, or I have
                                                petitioned, that agency to decide that the vehicle to be imported is eligible for importation, and
                                                NHTSA has granted me permission in writing to import the vehicle for that purpose. If the Administra-
                                                tor of NHTSA dismisses my petition, or decides that the vehicle is not eligible for importation, or if I
                                                withdraw my petition or I fail to submit a petition covering the vehicle within 180 days from the date
                                                of entry, then I state that I will deliver such vehicle, unless it is destroyed, to the Secretary of
                                                Homeland Security for export, or abandon it to the United States, within 30 days from the date of the
                                                dismissal, denial, or withdrawal of my petition, as appropriate, or within 210 days from the date of
                                                entry if I fail to submit a petition covering the vehicle. If the Administrator of NHTSA grants my
                                                petition, then I state that within 15 days from the date that I am notified of that decision, I will furnish
                                                a bond, in an amount equal to 150 percent of the entered value of the vehicle as determined by the
                                                Secretary of the Treasury, unless the vehicle is destroyed, to ensure that I will bring the vehicle into
                                                conformity with all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety and Bumper standards within 120 days
                                                from the date the petition is granted, or will deliver the vehicle to the Secretary of Homeland Security
                                                for export, or abandon it to the United States. If the vehicle is destroyed, then I state that I will furnish
                                                NHTSA with documentary proof of that destruction within 15 days from the date that it occurs.
